- Code style: prefer clear, readable JavaScript and CSS. Follow existing project conventions.
- Tests: this project has no automated tests; manual verification in the browser is sufficient.
- Accessibility: keep semantic HTML and provide alt text for images where appropriate.
- Large changes: open an issue first to discuss scope before implementing.
